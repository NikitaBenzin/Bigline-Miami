</h2>

<p>
   In main.cpp is creating game class and start run() function wich in while loop do update and render. </br>
   All staff is updating in Game class update function and rendering in render function </br>
   All .h files are linked with Game.h. Game class contains all classes exept of Gun class which created in Player class. </br>
   After creating all classes in Game.h we call name_class.update() in Game::update() function and name_class.render() in Game::render(). </br>
